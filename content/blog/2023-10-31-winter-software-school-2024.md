__Do you develop software for your research? Do you have some basic skills but desire more?__ If so, you might be interested in the upcoming URSSI Winter School in Research Software Engineering. Building off our [pilot workshop](https://urssi.us/blog/2020/01/29/report-from-the-urssi-winter-school-pilot/) held back in December 2019, we are hosting a 2.5-day workshop on research software engineering skills, to be held 3-5 January 2024 in Portland, Oregon. This is aimed at early-career researchers, including graduate students and postdocs, who are familiar with the basics such as the Unix shell, version control with Git, and Python programming, and would like to learn more about best practices for developing research software.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Target Audience</span>

The ideal candidate to attend this Winter School is a graduate student or postdoc who understands the basics of programming and version control but wants to learn more about software development practices. To get the most benefit from this workshop, we expect students to be familiar with the Unix shell, Python, and Git at the level taught at a Software Carpentry workshop.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Format and topics</span>

This 2.5 day, hands-on workshop will expose participants to a series of topics necessary for developing sustainable research software. Topics to be covered include:

*   **Software design and modularity**
*   **Collaborative software development via GitHub**
*   **Software testing in Python**
*   **Peer code review**
*   **Packaging and distributing Python software**
*   **Documentation**
*   **Licensing, open sharing, and software citation**

The school will consist of lectures on these topics along with hands-on exercises to allow the participants to practice the concepts covered in the lectures. To facilitate the hands-on experience, each participant will bring a project to work on throughout the course for applying these concepts.
